                                                                  ## How nice of you to visit! Welcome, I'm Kali 👋🏼 

                                      I’m a Cloud Application Developer focused on building **serverless, scalable applications** with AWS.

                                      I enjoy turning real-world problems into clean, automated systems — especially using
                                      Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and modern front-end frameworks.

                                      ## 🔧 What I’m Working On
                                      - Building full-stack serverless apps with AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
                                      - Connecting cloud backends to React frontends
                                      - Writing clean, understandable infrastructure-as-code (AWS SAM)
