*(Cloud Builder • Serverless Thinker • Systems-in-Progress)*

> I build cloud-native applications that turn messy ideas into clean, scalable systems, one service at a time.
Most days, that means experimenting with AWS, breaking things on purpose and fixing them.
I’m especially drawn to backend logic, cloud infrastructure, and the “glue” that connects systems together.
