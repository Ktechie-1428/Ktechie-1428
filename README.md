I’m a **Cloud Application Developer** focused on building modern, serverless applications on AWS.
I enjoy turning real-world ideas into clean, scalable systems — one service at a time ☁️

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **cloud infrastructure, backend logic, and thoughtful frontends**.

---

### 🧠 What I’m currently focused on
- Building **full-stack serverless applications** with AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- Connecting cloud backends to **React frontends**
- Writing clean, readable **infrastructure-as-code** using AWS SAM
- Gradually exploring **AI-powered features** that enhance real applications (not just demos 🤖)

---

### 🚀 Featured Project
**🐾 AWS Serverless Pet Shelter (In Progress)**  
A full-stack serverless application built with:
- AWS Lambda  
- API Gateway  
- DynamoDB  
- React  

👉 [View the repository](https://github.com/Ktechie-1428/Aws-Serverless-Pet-Shelter)

This project represents how I learn best: by building real systems and improving them over time.

---

### 🤍 What I care about
- Learning by **building**, not memorizing
- Writing code that other humans can understand
- Designing systems that are simple, scalable, and intentional
- Growing into a strong cloud engineer one project at a time
